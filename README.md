## Description
**Live version**: available [here](https://lunaireflare.github.io/calculator/).

This project was the last of the JS foundations section. As such, it aimed at bringing all the concepts studied so far. It particularly highlighted the importance of working out the logic of the program first, and encouraged spending time doing so before launching into coding itself. 

The mistake of ***not*** doing that still occurred, but made it crystal clear how important this step of the process is. Despite relying heavily on research and other people's codes to complete this project, it was really challenging and helped further my understanding of the whole process and how functions interact with each other. 

### Features
- Browser calculator handling basic math operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
- Two clearing buttons: one for entire display, one for last character submitted
- Decimal numbers support

>**Features planned**: parenthesis handling, keyboard support.

### Practiced Skills
- Functions named & anonymous, callbacks
- Clear code: smaller functions, ordering logic (*i.e* event listeners close to their functions)
- Conceptualization, pseudocode, console logging
- DOM manipulation & event listeners
- CSS elements (transitions, properties, cascade rules...)
- Flexbox layout

### Encountered Pitfalls
- Not spending enough time working out the logic first led to losing quite a bit of time later on
- Understanding the differences between the numeric variables and their string representation on the displays
